<p>Linker sequences can be added to either the 5' or 3' end of the sequence.  After selecting the <a href="add_linkers.html">add linkers button </a> from the Mutation Panel, the current sequence in the sequence display box will be displayed in the sequence box on the Linker Panel.
</p>
<p>Linkers are given a name. This name will be how the linker sequence appears in the box to the right.  Enter the nucleotide sequence associated with the linker in the appropriate box.  If there is a restriction enzyme associated with the linker (e.g. BglI), then it should be listed in the appropriate box.</p>
