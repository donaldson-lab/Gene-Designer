<h2>Mutations</h2>
<a href="help.html">Back to Main Help Navigation Page</a><p>
<p>Gene Designer can be used to insert mutations in to nucleotide sequences.  The number of mutations and location of the mutation in the sequence can be controlled.  Multiple mutant sequences can be created at once.  The mutated sequence will appear in the <a href="mutation_display.html">mutated sequence display box.</a>  Mutations will be highlighted in red.  For silent mutations the afffected codon is highlighted. For random mutations the affected nucleotide is highlighted.  The location of the mutation is also listed.  For silent mutations the position listed refers to the position of the first nucleotide in the affected codon.  Mutated sequences can be exported as FASTA files by clicking the Export button.
</p>
<p>Mutations can also be made in an amino acid sequence.  The Random AA Mutations button will insert random amino acid mutations into the sequence.  A range and number of mutations can also be specified.  You can also manually specify mutations by clicking inside of the amino acid sequence box and changing the desired amino acid.  Upon clicking the Engineer Mutations button.  The nucleotide sequence will be mutated to reflect the changed amino acids.  The codon chosen will be the most prevalent codon for the changed amino acid from the organism currently selected in the <a href="codon_usage.html">codon usage database.</a>  The default organism is E. coli K-12.  If the avoid reversion box is checked, codons will be chosen by Gene Designer that have at least two amino acids mutated.</p>
<p>The Insertions button will open a pop-up dialog where you can type in an amino acid sequence to be inserted at the current position of the cursor.  If you highlight a portion of the amino acid sequence and click delete, the changes will be refelcted in the nucleotide sequence.  Deleting amino acids by just pressing the backspace key will not result in changes to the nucleotide sequence and could give wrong results.</p>
